# FootballBIFFIndex
<p><b>Hello!</b></p>
<p>This is the BIFF index website. This is a personal project I'm doing to rank every single play in the NFL in the 21st century in which they went for it on 4th down. I'm using an arbitary arithmetic means to find their BIFF score. More on that can be found in <a href= "https://github.com/NickQuigley02/FootballAnalysis>" title = "Football Analysis Repository">this</a> repository. </p>
<p>BIFF Stands for Bravery Index of Fourth-down Football, and it is modeled after <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9H9LwGmc-0" title="this excellent Jon Bois on Punting.">this excellent Jon Bois on Punting.</a></p>
<p>The site still needs a lot of work, and I'd say it's maybe 10% done. The current order of priorities for the website would be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Finish out the top 10 list</li>
  <li>Solidify the mathmatics of it, I have some questions</li>
  <li>Introduce a page for analyzing the total results</li>
  <li>Introduce a page for showing what I used for code to find these results</li>
  <li>Make it mobile-friendly</li>
 </ul>
