			<p>On Sunday, January 11, 2004, the Indianapolis Colts faced off against the Kansas City Chiefs in what has been remembered as one of the most impressive offensive displays in NFL history. Pro-bowler Trent Green, quarterback for the Chiefs, was having a phenomenal year, throwing for over 4000 yards, with a 2:1 touchdown-to-interception ratio. His counterpart for the Colts was first-team All-Pro Peyton Manning, coming off a wildcard victory against the Denver Broncos, in which Manning passed for five touchdowns. </p>
			<p>The meeting was as explosive as one would expect, with both teams scoring over 30 points. It was also interesting for another reason; there were no punts by either team. Of the eight 4th down situations, there were three Field Goals, three Passes, one failed rush, and a penalty that gave a first down. It was the only time in NFL post-season history, before or since, that this has happened. The Colts ended up beating the Chiefs in a score of 38 to 31, before losing themselves to the future Super Bowl XXXVIII champions, the New England Patriots. </p>
			<p>The game was incredible, but it was also expected. Two great teams made some great plays. The only times they went for it on 4th down were either very sensible decisions, or desperation plays. But what of the unexpected fourth down plays? What of the times in which it was neither sensible or necessary to roll the dice? What of the plays fueled only by a confidence in the team and the bravery to call terrible plans?</p>
			<p>To this end, I have ranked every single 4th down play where they went for it in the 21st century by how '<em>brave</em>' you could passively-aggressively call them. The results compiled represent an interesting set of observations based on a completely arbitrary scaling system designed to express my excitement. They should be in no way taken as mathematically rigorous or entirely truthful.</p>

		<p>To start, I'd like to thank Sports Reference for their incredibly vast repository of football data (and excellent UX) which made this project possible, as well as Jon Bois, whose excellent video,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9H9LwGmc-0" title="The excellent Jon Bois piece that inspired this work."> <em>The search for the saddest punt in the world.</em></a> inspired this project.</p>
		<p>In this video, Mr. Bois ranks the punts made in the 21st century by combining several factors, such as score, quarter, field position and the yardage they need, into a single number through an arbitary arithmatetic function. I've done something very similar, but in a far more optimistic light.</p>
		<p>The Bravery Index of Fourth-down Football, or BIFF, is a simple mathmatical model. Firstly, it takes the yards the team needs to advance the ball in order to move the chains, then finds the triple of the natural log of this number plus one. This gives the formula a concrete number to start with. I used the natural log to gain a curve of diminishing returns, to represent that a 4th and 1 situation is much different than a 4th and 5, but a 4th and 20 and a 4th and 25 are considerably less different.</p>
		<p>The BIFF then takes the field position of the team and converts that to a sinoidal curve that peaks around each endzone, representing how I think it's more exciting when a team goes for it further from the center of the field, in which there are no obvious answers on what should be done. The BIFF number is multiplied by the value of the curve at the the team's position. </p>
		<p>Next, the time remaining in the game (inclusive of a single overtime) is taken and put through a decreasing linear function that starts at 210 and goes down to 0 by 70 minutes. This helps sink desperation calls compared to truly brave plays, that are going to happen earlier in the game rather than later.</p>
		<p>The final step of the BIFF index is to give the number a multiplier based on the score differential.</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>If the team is losing by more than 7, it's probably a desperation play, so it recieves a x1 multiplier.</li>
		  <li>If the team is losing by less than a touchdown, but more than field goal, this increases to x1.5.</li>
		  <li>If the team is losing by less than a field goal, then commendations must be made, and the multiplier is x2.</li>
		  <li>Should the teams be tied when one decides to go for it, that impressive disregard for caution awards the highest multiplier of x2.5. </li>
		  <li>Past this point, the multiplier decreases to x1.5 if you're within a field goal.</li>
		  <li>It then goes to x0.75 if the game is being won, but by less than a touchdown. </li>
		  <li>Finally, it goes all the way down to x0.2 for games the team is winning by more than 7 points, as this is a play with minimal stakes.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>The BIFF, however, was just an equation, and I wanted to see dumb plays. After gathering up the data as a CSV file from<a href="https://stathead.com/football/play_finder.cgi" title="Stathead Football's Playfinder."> <em>Stathead Football's Playfinder</em></a>, I made a Python program to take in this file, clean and format it's data from strings into numbers, and spit out a BIFF number, which was then addended as a new column to the file. I then used a simple Bash script to remove a few anomolies, such as blocked kicks and muffed punts, that I did not want to pollute the dataset.</p>
		<p>From that point on, all I had to do was bring this new dataset into Microsoft Excel and play around with it for graphs, trends and rankings to find my dumb/brave plays.</p>

			<section id="entryBody">
				<p>The same explosive offenses that met in January of 2004 would meet again for a regular season rematch on Halloween that same year. It seems both teams started right where they left off, with the Colts going for it on fourth and 14 early in the first quarter.</p>
				<p>They were in a no-mans land, near the center of the field at the Colts' 43. Their kicker that year was Mike Vanderjagt, an kicker who easily has one of the most interesting Wikipedia pages for any kicker in the league. He was just coming off an incredible 2003 season in which he missed <em>no</em> kicks. But his longest kick, at any point in his career, was 55 yards. By no means a chip-shot, but a full 20 yards shorter than the line of scrimmage.</p>
				<p>They had the option to punt, but they were on midfield. A turnover here wouldn't mean as much of difference than a turnover 30 yards downfield. At least, not with an offense as potent as these two teams had. </p>
				<p>Their punter, Hunter Smith, who also has a phenomenal Wikipedia page, made use of his Highschool QB play and took the snap. He was unable to make the first down markers, or even a first yard, but this aggressive, gutsy playcalling would help lead the Colts to their incredibly entertaining 35-45 loss to the Chiefs.</p>

				<strong>Colts vs. Cowboys</strong>

				<p>It is no doubt a more knowledgable reader would guess Pat Mcafee would make an appearance on this list. But not, interestingly enough, for the so-dubbed "worst NFL play of all time" against the Patriots, but an entirey seperate fake punt. Something Mcafee honestly had an underrated career doing.</p>
				<p>Rather, in this Week 16 matchup, we saw two play-off bound titans get off to a powerful start. The Dallas Cowboys opened the game with a dominating, almost 9 minute drive capped off by a Tony Romo touchdown pass to Terrence Williams.</p>
				<p>In order to respond to this tour-de-force, the Colts had to be aggressive, subversive, and take full advantage of their incredible offensive weapons. On their opening drive, Indianapolis, through a combination of handoffs, shovel passes, and not utilizing their generational talent in Andrew Luck, gained -1 yards. </p>
				<p>But, the game was not lost, and the team sensibly trotted out their punt team, led by star punter Pat Mcafee. But as the ball was snapped, Mcafee dropped back and threw an incredible pass 35 yards down the field to an open receiver, safety Dewey McDonald. They had successfully caught the Dallas special teams entirely off guard by their aggression. They were in a great position to capitalize on the gamble as well, as few but the kick returner were in a solid position to respond to McDonald.</p>
				<p>Unfortunately, McDonald dropped the ball.</p>

				<strong>Jaguars vs. Broncos</strong>
			</section>
			<section id="entryBody">
				<p>In one of the biggest mismatches of the 2013 season, between the Jacksonville Jaguars (under journeyman Quarterback Chad Henne) and the Denver Broncos (under the first 4x MVP Peyton Manning) the lowly Jags defied several expectations. While they would not go on to win this game, or most of their games in this dissapointing 4-12 season, they certainly punched above their weight in Halloween game.</p>
				<p>This specific play wasn't actually all that unreasonable. With just 4 yards to go, the Jaguars actually had a better-than-half chance to make it. It's on this list because they made this gamble halfway into their own territory, just <em>43 seconds</em> into the game on their first possesion. It goes without saying that it was a tied ball game at this point.</p>
				<p>The fake punt itself was fairly unique as well. Instead of going to the punter, the ball was snapped to the right side, to Will Taʻufoʻou, a veteran Practice Sqadder elevated after the Jaguars primary Fullback Greg Jones signed with the Houston Texans. From the right guard, Ta'ufo'ou rushed forward with the ball.</p>
				<p>The Denver Broncos, however, managed to stuff the run after only a single yard of forward progress. This action failed to move the chains, leading to a turn-over on downs that a minute later, would lead to the Broncos first of many touchdowns that game.</p>
